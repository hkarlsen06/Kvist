# Development Instructions

After changes affecting the runnable app, build and install the newest build to /Applications. Documentation-only or instruction-only edits do not require a rebuild or install.

## Modal dialogs

Use `AppDialog` (`NSAlert`) for prompts and confirmations, and `NSOpenPanel` or
`NSSavePanel` for filesystem choices. Do not implement modals with a borderless
`NSPanel` containing an `NSHostingView` and `NSApp.runModal`: when attached to
the SwiftUI window it may render correctly without receiving mouse events.

The affected input prompts are stash, create/rename branch, clone repository,
open over SSH, add/edit/link remote, and create tag. Keep them on the shared
`AppDialog` path. The “Save Changes?” prompt is the known-good reference: its
disclosure content is an `NSAlert` accessory view.

For `NSAlert` accessory forms, give text fields an explicit width and size the
accessory stack with `fittingSize`; guessed heights or intrinsic placeholder
widths clip multi-row forms. Clear the Return key equivalent on destructive
buttons unless a primary action is present.

## Tab performance benchmark

Run `Scripts/benchmark-tabs.sh` after changes to repository tabs, workspace
restoration, lazy repository loading, loading and empty states, tab switching,
repository watcher ownership, or tab-related task cancellation. The benchmark
uses 20 isolated temporary repositories and checks unopened and loaded switch
latency, rapid cycling, memory growth, main-thread stalls, idle use, and orphan
watchers, processes, or tasks.
